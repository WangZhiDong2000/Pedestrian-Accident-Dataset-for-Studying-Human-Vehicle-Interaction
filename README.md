# Pedestrian-Accident-Dataset-for-Studying-Human-Vehicle-Interaction
We establish a dataset collected from adversary scenarios of pedestrian accidents occurred in mainland China during 2023-2024 recorded by closed circuit television or inside cameras. Then we study the human-vehicle interactions and recognize five types of patterns of pedestrian behavior: standard social force model (SFM), abrupt acceleration, distraction, fluster due to occlusion and running.

This dataset contains 106 records of pedestrian accidents, including 16 accelerating cases, 32 distracted cases, 8 SFM cases, 24 occlusion cases, 26 running cases. For a wider range of uses, the records are not pre-processed. Thank for the uploaders on https://www.bilibili.com/.
